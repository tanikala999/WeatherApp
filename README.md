# WeatherApp

This is my first Android app in Kotlin. 

It displays the weather in the current location, as well as some characteristics (like humidity, pressure, etc.), the user can also search for other cities. The data can change between metric and imperial values. The user can come back to the current location weather at any time by clicking at the button.
